# Cash Register Web App

Welcome to the Cash Register web application! This web app is built with Next.js and allows you to create a cash register that can keep track of money and dispense change. It handles bills of denominations $20, $10, $5, $2, and $1. You can add money to the register, take money from the register, and dispense change for specific dollar amounts. If change cannot be made using the bills in the register, it raises an error.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. The app will be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Running tests

To run the tests, run `npm run test` in the terminal. This will run the tests in watch mode.
